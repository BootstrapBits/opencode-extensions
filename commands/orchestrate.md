I need to create a multi-agent orchestration plan for this project.

Please load the `subagent-orchestration` skill and guide me through the process of:

1. Understanding my spec/plan document
2. Exploring the codebase structure
3. Answering interview questions about my workflow preferences
4. Generating a comprehensive orchestration plan
